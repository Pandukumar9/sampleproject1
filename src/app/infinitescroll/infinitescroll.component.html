  First, we create a new IntersectionObserver which receives entries as its argument. This function will be called whenever the observed element enters the viewport.
We can check the element’s visibility status by looking at the isIntersection property. If isIntersecting is true, the target element has become at least as visible as the threshold that was passed. The default threshold is 0, meaning as soon as even one pixel is visible, the callback will be run.
Next, we call the observe() method, passing it the anchor element. This will initiate the observation of this element.First, we create a new IntersectionObserver which receives entries as its argument. This function will be called whenever the observed element enters the viewport.
